# Input methods and privacy

Checked 2026-10-02; voice decision updated 2026-10-05.

The browser activity keeps its essential path deliberately small: keyboard and touch are the dependable inputs. Optional methods must remain user-initiated, clearly visible, reversible, and scoped to the current exercise.

## Voice

The site does not offer voice input and never requests the microphone.

An optional, on-device voice mode was developed and tested in Firefox Nightly, including a closed vocabulary of numbers and safe commands. In real use the browser's recognizer could not yet reliably hear isolated short words such as “next”, and an unreliable voice interface is worse for a learner than none. That work is parked on the `voice-integration` branch and continues separately; it will return to the site only when it works reliably.

No speech model is bundled. Mistral documents Voxtral Mini 4B Realtime as a four-billion-parameter model, recommends a vLLM server, and labels its ExecuTorch on-device path untested. That is not a moderate browser download for this project.

## Pen and handwriting

Pointer Events already give the web a common input model for mouse, touch, and pen, including pressure and pointer type. That would make a future ink canvas straightforward, including input from many Wacom devices.

Ink capture is not the difficult part; reliable mathematical handwriting recognition is. Wacom's web tooling focuses on digital ink, while MyScript's iinkJS web integration sends recognition requests to the MyScript Cloud and requires application credentials. The studio will not disguise a remote recognition service as a local feature or maintain home-grown character-recognition code.

Handwriting recognition is therefore deferred until a well-supported, lightweight, privacy-appropriate browser solution is available. Mouse, touch, stylus, and keyboard continue to work through the ordinary controls.

## Webcam and sign language

Webcam gesture or sign-language recognition is out of scope. The site does not request camera access.
